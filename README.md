#### Mobile first
While not forgetting the full-sized screens, this app really shines on the smartphone/tablets screens.


## Components used

Axios makes it really easy to work with ajax requests and has a great browser support.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
